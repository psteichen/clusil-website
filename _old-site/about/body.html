  With about 250 members and nearly 20 years of existence, the CLUSIL is a well established and recognized actor among the Information Security Landscape of Luxemburg and of the “Grande Region”.

  CLUSIL will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2016,  in just 20 years we have come a very long way and are very proud.
  </p><p>
  The slogan of the CLUSIL is “by the experts for the experts”, meaning that all different professional experts concerned will find their added value by being member of the CLUSIL.

  Thus my colleagues of the board and myself would like to invite all of you involved with information security to become member of the CLUSIL and to benefit from the exhaustive knowledge present, the possibility to exchange information among peers and to actively contribute to the promotion and enhancement of information security.
