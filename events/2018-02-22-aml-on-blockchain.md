Alberto Ornaghi, Neutrino's Chief Technology Officer (http://www.neutrino.nu/), and Giancarlo Russo, Neutrino's Chief Executive Officer, will present How-To perform Anti Money Laundering checks and detect suspicious transactions on the bitcoin network, extending the traditional “follow the money” approach also to the dark web.

In particular, they will present how, based on advanced machine learning engines and “clustering” techniques, it is possible to monitor, analyze and track the blockchain and all bitcoin activities providing actionable compliance insight, including setting-up customized “red flag” alerts based on location (“blacklist” approach), detection of money obfuscation schemes (“mixer” and “tumbler”), and bitcoins with suspicious origin/destinations linked to darknet activities.

The techniques and tools presented are used by Law Enforcement, Compliance and Regulatory Organizations and by simple bitcoins network participants.

The presentation is addressed to both technical and non-technical audience (including Compliance, Risk and Audit professionals).
