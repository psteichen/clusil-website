**CLUSIL** is pleased to announce you once again the creation of a working group dedicated to **Business Continuity Management** (BCM) by Werner ANSORGE.

#### Goal

The goal of the working group could be among others to:

* Discuss together our general understanding of BCM, mainly of the ISO norms 22301 and 22313
* Exchange experiences and lessons learned
* How to write Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) and Business Continuity Plans (BCP)
* How to organise DRP and BCP tests
* How to carry out a Business Impact Analysis

With the **final goal** to create supporting material for all of us to ease our lives as BCM managers.  
   
During the first working session, we will define together the topics of interests for the next coming months, and which deliverable we would like to create together.  
   
As well, during the first working session, you can express your interest in supporting Werner as co-leader for this new working group.
