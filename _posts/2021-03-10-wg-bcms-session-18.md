##### **Session 18**:

2020 was an interesting and challenging year for CLUSIL and our working group BCMS.

A presentation will be held by Marc Tielemans, RealCGR.

Agenda:

* - The benefits of an integrated BCMS
* - What does integrated means in this context? (automation, communication, maintenance, security, usability,...)
* - What maturity level is required when stepping to a integrated BCMS?
* - What do you need to pay attention to? (security, vendor lock-in, availability of services, availability of consultants,...)
