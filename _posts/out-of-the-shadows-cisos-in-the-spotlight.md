The aim of this survey is to analyse the roles and responsibilities of CISOs / ISOs in Luxembourg in order to gain detailed insights into the position.

If you're a (C)ISO and you would like to particpate in this survey, contact [us](mailto:secgen@securitymadein.lu) to receive the link for the survey. Please take note that the deadline to respond is set on **_5 July 2020._**

The **“Out of the shadows: CISOs in the spotlight!”** survey, co-sponsored by CLUSIL and PwC, is anonymous. Neither your name nor that of your organisation will be associated with your answers, and your responses will be used only in combination with those of other survey respondents.

We plan to share the results of the survey during the PwC Cybersecurity Day, which will take place on 29 October 2020.

More information coming soon...

Thank you in advance for participating in this survey. Your insights will help us, and help you, to get a clearer picture of how the CISO / ISO’s role and responsibilities are evolving.
