Dear CLUSIL members,

It is our pleasure to invite you to the 20th session of the WG-BCMS, and preferably a physical meeting. This working group is dedicated to Business Continuity Management (BCMS) and is addressed to all BCM managers and people interested in BCM in general.

As it will be our first physical meeting since September 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis, let's continue together to review the CSSF circular 21/769 - "Governance and security requirements for Supervised Entities to perform tasks or activities through Telework" and to analyse, how it will apply in the future our way of working and our implemented BCP solutions.
