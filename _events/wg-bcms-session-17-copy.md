##### **Session 18**:

2020 was an interesting and challenging year for CLUSIL and our working group BCMS.

All means were put in place so that we were able to meet despite the lockdown. I admit, sometimes bandwidth problems decreased the sound and video quality, but overall it was possible to continue with our WG BCMS sessions.

In September, we even managed to meet each other in person and have a drink together, and I hope that, in 2021, we will have the opportunity to have more face-to-face meetings.

For 2021 we would like to inform you, that we are planning a session in March to present a solution for managing BCMS and an on-site visit of a data center in Q3 or Q4.

The scheduled dates for 2021 so far are:

* - Session #18 - 10/03
* - Session #19 - 12/05
* - Session #20 - 07/07
* - Session #21 - 08/09
* - Session #22 - 10/11

Wishing all of you a very nice Christmas time and a happy new year.
