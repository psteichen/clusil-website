**Setting the scene**  
Quote: "On 8th May 2018, Luxembourg presented its 3rd National Cybersecurity Strategy. The challenge: to provide an environment conducive to digital development, while ensuring maximum security for all stakeholders.  
  
**Informed Governance**  
Technological and human failures increasingly confirm how much managers, experts and users are still unaware of ICT risks. The issue for the growth of a modern economy like Luxembourg is:  How well do we know how to tackle this situation? What do we undertake for the optimisation of existing managing methods, share and coordinate the knowledge and expertise among security key players?  
   
**Biography**  
After 10 years of IT experience in international banking, Francois joined the Ministry of the Economy in Luxembourg in 2001 as responsible for IT security, and is to date the Director of the department for e-commerce and information security.   
   
Furthermore, François Thill represents Luxembourg on the management board of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) since 2003; he is member of the board of LuxTrust, chair of the board of [Securitymadein.lu](https://securitymadein.lu/ "SecurityMadeIn.lu"), member of the Luxembourg Cyber Security Board, and an alternate member of the Data Protection Authority in Luxembourg.  
   
The conference is free of charge for ISACA and CLUSIL members, our partner associations as well as anyone interested in the topic.
