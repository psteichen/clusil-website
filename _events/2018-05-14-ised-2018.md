The Information Security Education Day (ISED) is a yearly one-day event co-organized by the [University of Luxembourg](http://www.uni.lu/) (Computer Science and Communication Research Unit - [CSC](https://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fstc/computer_science_and_communications_research_unit)) and the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST)](https://www.list.lu/), sponsored by CLUSIL.

#### **Why an Education Day?** 

ISED is a yearly event aiming at providing new knowledge on a hot-topic related to security and privacy. The conference primarily targets the current and former students of the professional [MSSI Master (Master en management de la sécurité des systèmes d'information)](http://wwwen.uni.lu/studies/fstc/master_en_management_de_la_securite_des_systemes_d_information_professionnel).

#### **Why is it open to all practitioners?** 

ISED provides an ideal forum where academics and practitioners can learn about the different facets of a key-topic, exchange and discuss ideas, and compare experiences. In this spirit, ISED seeks to be an interdisciplinary event, open to all. The speakers will bring their expertise in different areas covering the legal, technical and research-wise facets of the theme.
